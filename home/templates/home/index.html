                <p>Wildlifers programs are designed to bring awareness and also for us to make a small contribution
                    to our planet's ecosystem. Our planet is made up of several species, each uniquely contributing to the natural processes of our planet's ecosystems. 
                    Although it's easy to ignore the place of wildlife in our world due to how distant some animals seem, 
                    thereâ€™s no denying the roles wildlife plays in the grand scheme. </p>

                <p>Many of us automatically consider how global warming and climate change impact human life. However, 
                    we need to examine how the changing climate system affects animals. 
                    And we also need to consider the impact of human actions like overhunting, pollution, deforestation, and commercial fishing on animal populations. 
                    Although many animals are finding ways to adapt to changes like habitat loss, not all of them have been able to find their way through. </p>
