                <p>Our planet is made up of several species, each uniquely contributing to the natural processes of our planet's ecosystems. 
                    Although it's easy to ignore the place of wildlife in our world due to how distant some animals seem, 
                    thereâ€™s no denying the roles wildlife plays in the grand scheme. </p>

                <p>Experts agree that one of the best ways of saving the planet is through transformation of the global food system, 
                    with agriculture accounting for nearly 60% of global biodiversity loss and about a quarter of CO2 emissions worldwide.
                    Consumers can make a difference by choosing to eat less meat and making more sustainable food choices, 
                    as farming animals uses a lot of land and water.
                    Meanwhile farmers can be supported to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides, 
                    diversify crops and phase out ploughing to lessen the environmental impact.</p>
